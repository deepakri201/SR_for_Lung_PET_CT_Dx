# DICOM Structured Reports for Lung-PET-CT-Dx 

This repository contains the code used to create DICOM Structured Reports for the Lung-PET-CT-Dx collection. We use the annotations provided by TCIA, in which bounding boxes are defined for the lesions, including the subtype. 

Additionally we provide demos illustrating the usefulness of these bounding boxes for foundation models.
